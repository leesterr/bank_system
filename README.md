<h1>Bank system made with SQLite in Python</h1>
<h3>This is just a demo for how bank activities are carried out.
You don't need to install any library.</h3>

<p>I created this program as I was learning databases. I hope it will teach you some basics of databases.
I used SQLite to simplify things as it supported natively in python programming language.<br />
The logic of bank system just get me attention to simulate the bank activities.</p>
<p>To start using, run customer.py and follow whatever it says.
Contributions are highly appreciated</p>
